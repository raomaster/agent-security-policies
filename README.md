## Quick Install

One command — zero dependencies. Copies `AGENT_RULES.md` + `policies/` + `skills/` and generates the config file your agent auto-detects.

### npx (Cross-platform — recommended)

```bash
# All agents + security skills
npx agent-security-policies --all

# Interactive mode — guided setup
npx agent-security-policies

# Specific agents only
npx agent-security-policies --agent copilot,claude --skills

# OpenCode with oh-my-opencode (installs Aegis agent + commands)
npx agent-security-policies --agent opencode --skills --omo

# Local-only setup (files gitignored, each dev runs npx after clone)
npx agent-security-policies --all --gitignore

# List available agents, profiles, and skills
npx agent-security-policies --list
```

### Linux / macOS

```bash
# All agents + security skills (Copilot, Codex CLI, Claude CLI, Antigravity)
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raomaster/agent-security-policies/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --all

# Specific agents only
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raomaster/agent-security-policies/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --agent copilot,claude
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
# All agents + security skills
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raomaster/agent-security-policies/main/install.ps1 | iex

# Or download and run with options
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raomaster/agent-security-policies/main/install.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1
.\install.ps1 -Agent copilot,codex,claude,antigravity
```

### From local clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raomaster/agent-security-policies.git
cd agent-security-policies
./install.sh --all --target /path/to/your/project
```

`--all` installs both agent configs and the full security skills pack. Use `--agent ...` without `--skills` for rules-only setup.

### What gets generated

| Agent | File created | Auto-detected by |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | VS Code + JetBrains |
| Codex CLI | `AGENTS.md` | Codex CLI (OpenAI) |
| Claude CLI | `CLAUDE.md` | Claude Code (Anthropic) |
| Antigravity | `.agent/rules/security.md` | Gemini (Google) |
| OpenCode | `.claude/rules/security.md` | oh-my-opencode |

All files reference `AGENT_RULES.md` with key rules inline. Non-destructive — existing files are never overwritten; security rules are appended with your confirmation.

## 🚀 Agent Security Skills (NEW in v1.3)

`agent-security-policies` ships with an extensible framework of **Security Skills** — atomic, zero-dependency actions that your AI agent can execute to proactively locate and fix security vulnerabilities.

| Skill | Tool | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| `sast-scan` | Semgrep | CWE-mapped code vulnerabilities (JSON) |
| `secrets-scan` | Gitleaks | Hardcoded secrets and credentials (JSON) |
| `dependency-scan` | Trivy | Known CVEs in packages (JSON) |
| `container-scan` | Trivy | Container image misconfigurations (JSON) |
| `iac-scan` | Trivy | Terraform / Helm / K8s issues (JSON) |
| `threat-model` | Agent | STRIDE threat model (Markdown) |
| `fix-findings` | Agent | Automated fixes from any scan output |
| `security-review` | Agent | Multi-phase code review, no Docker required |

Skills chain together: `sast-scan` → `fix-findings`, `dependency-scan` → `fix-findings`.

> Want your agent to learn a new trick? See the [Skills Design and Creation Guide](skills/README.md).

## Agent Security Commands

`agent-security-policies` ships with **3 user-invocable commands** that you can trigger directly in your agent session. Installed to `.opencode/command/` (oh-my-opencode) or the agent-specific commands directory.

| Command | Invocation | When to use |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| `security-review` | `/security-review` | Full 3-phase security audit: static analysis → dependency check → secrets scan |
| `checkpoint` | `/checkpoint [label]` | Before asking the agent to do something large or risky |
| `rollback` | `/rollback [label]` | When the agent's output is not acceptable and you need to revert |

### /checkpoint — manual safety net

`/checkpoint` creates a labeled `git stash` of your current working tree, then immediately restores it (`git stash pop`). The stash stays as a recoverable backup while you continue working.

**When to run it:**
- Before a large refactor you are not sure about
- Before asking the agent to touch auth, crypto, or session logic
- Before a database schema migration
- Before mass file deletions or moves
- Before upgrading multiple dependencies at once

**When NOT to run it:**
- Before routine edits (typo fix, comment, formatting)
- When the working tree is clean — git history already covers you

> Aegis will suggest `/checkpoint` when it detects a high-risk task, but it will never invoke it automatically. The decision is always yours.

```bash
/checkpoint before-auth-refactor
# ... let the agent work ...
/rollback before-auth-refactor   # if something goes wrong
```

### /rollback — undo agent changes

`/rollback [label]` restores the working tree to a named checkpoint. If no label is given, it lists available checkpoints and asks which one to restore.

> Rollback is cheaper than trying to repair bad agent output with follow-up prompts. Roll back → improve the plan → retry.

Install commands with:

```bash
npx agent-security-policies --agent opencode --skills --omo
```

---

## Delivery Options

1. **Canonical repo-root (recommended)**
   - Keep `AGENT_RULES.md` and `policies/` at project root.
   - Lowest maintenance, easiest for CI and contributors.
2. **Shared monorepo policy**
   - Keep a single policy set at monorepo root and reference it from each service.
   - Best when all teams must enforce the same baseline.
3. **Per-service policy**
   - Each service owns its own `AGENT_RULES.md` and `policies/`.
   - Best when risk profiles differ (for example, `payments` vs `frontend`).

---

## Enforcement Levels

After installing, you can tune **how strictly** your agent enforces the rules by adding one of these snippets to your agent's instructions. This is independent of `--profile` (which controls file size / token budget).

### Minimal

```
Read and follow AGENT_RULES.md for secure coding basics.
Use policies/base_policy.yaml as mandatory baseline.
```

### Standard (default behavior — no extra instructions needed)

```
Read and follow AGENT_RULES.md.
Apply policies/base_policy.yaml + policies/owasp_asvs.yaml.
Use cwe_top25.yaml as prevention checklist during implementation.
```

### Strict

```
Enforce ALL rules in AGENT_RULES.md and ALL YAML files in policies/.
Block insecure patterns (hardcoded secrets, shell=True, unvalidated input).
Require ASVS chapter-by-chapter audit with severity scoring before final output.
```

> **Tip:** Enforcement levels work with any profile. For example, `--profile lite` + a Strict snippet gives you compact rules with maximum rigor.

---

## Agent Setup

### GitHub Copilot

#### VS Code + JetBrains (universal method)

Create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` at the project root. Copilot Chat reads this file **automatically** in both VS Code and JetBrains — no IDE settings needed.

```markdown
Follow ALL security and code quality rules defined in AGENT_RULES.md.

Key mandatory rules:
- Apply OWASP ASVS 5.0.0 to every change
- Prevent all CWE/SANS Top 25 2025 weaknesses
- Use typed exceptions, never bare except
- Never hardcode secrets (CWE-798)
- Validate all inputs at trust boundaries (CWE-20)
- shell=False in subprocess calls (CWE-78)
- Type hints + docstrings on all public APIs
- Structured logging with correlation IDs

Reference policies/ for detailed YAML security rulesets.
```

#### VS Code — additional option (settings.json)

Add this to `.vscode/settings.json` (project-level) or your User Settings JSON (global):

```json
{
  "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions": [
    {
      "file": "AGENT_RULES.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

> **How to open Settings JSON:** `Ctrl+Shift+P` → `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`

#### JetBrains — additional option (IDE settings)

1. Go to **Settings** → **Languages & Frameworks** → **GitHub Copilot**
2. Find the **Copilot Chat** → **Custom Instructions** field
3. Paste:

```
Follow ALL security rules in AGENT_RULES.md.
Apply OWASP ASVS 5.0.0, CWE/SANS Top 25 2025, NIST SSDF to every change.
Never hardcode secrets. Validate all inputs. Use typed exceptions.
Reference policies/ for YAML security rulesets.
```

#### Summary

| IDE | Easiest method | Where |

    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Build a REST API for user management"}
    ]
)
```

---

### Gemini Code Assist / Antigravity

#### Gemini in IDE

Create `.gemini/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "codeAssist": {
    "systemInstructions": "Read and follow all rules in AGENT_RULES.md. Apply OWASP ASVS 5.0.0, CWE/SANS Top 25 2025, and NIST SSDF to all code."
  }
}
```

#### Antigravity with workflows

Create `.agent/workflows/secure-coding.md`:

```markdown
---
description: Apply secure coding standards to all changes
---
1. Read `AGENT_RULES.md` for the complete security ruleset.
2. Apply all 11 mandatory rule domains to every code change.
3. Reference `policies/` for detailed YAML policies.
4. When planning, include a STRIDE threat model.
5. When reviewing, use the OWASP ASVS 5.0.0 checklist and severity scoring.
```

---

### Cline / Roo Code (VS Code)

Create `.clinerules` at the project root:

```
Read AGENT_RULES.md and follow ALL rules.
Apply OWASP ASVS 5.0.0, CWE/SANS Top 25 2025, and NIST SSDF.
Use policies/ YAML files as structured reference.
```

---

### Aider

#### Option A: Config file

Create `.aider.conf.yml` at the project root:

```yaml
read:
  - AGENT_RULES.md
```

#### Option B: CLI flag

```bash
aider --read AGENT_RULES.md
```

---

### Continue.dev

Edit `.continue/config.json`:

```json
{
  "systemMessage": "Read and follow all security rules in AGENT_RULES.md. Apply OWASP ASVS 5.0.0, CWE/SANS Top 25, and all mandatory rules to every code change.",
  "docs": [
    {
      "title": "Security Rules",
      "startUrl": "AGENT_RULES.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### OpenCode

OpenCode reads rules from `.claude/rules/` automatically via oh-my-opencode.

#### Vanilla mode (without oh-my-opencode)

Place `AGENT_RULES.md` at project root. OpenCode will pick it up if you reference it in your session.

#### With oh-my-opencode (recommended)

oh-my-opencode discovers rules, skills, and commands from standard directories:

```bash
# Install rules + skills + Aegis agent + commands
npx agent-security-policies --agent opencode --skills --omo

# Or with gitignore support
npx agent-security-policies --agent opencode --skills --omo --gitignore
```

This creates:
- `.claude/rules/security.md` — auto-loaded security rules
- `.opencode/skills/security-review/SKILL.md` — security-review skill
- `.opencode/command/security-review.md` — `/security-review` command
- `.opencode/command/checkpoint.md` — `/checkpoint` command
- `.opencode/command/rollback.md` — `/rollback` command
- `.claude/agents/aegis.md` — Aegis security subagent (see below)

---

### Aegis Security Agent

**Aegis** is a specialized security subagent installed to `.claude/agents/aegis.md` when using OpenCode with oh-my-opencode (`--omo`).

Aegis is activated automatically (`mode: all`) on every task — it shadows the main agent and enforces security constraints proactively, rather than reactively. It operates with:

- Full OWASP ASVS 5.0.0 + Proactive Controls 2024 enforcement
- CWE/SANS Top 25 2025 prevention
- Git Safety Protocol (Rule 12)
- Authority to block insecure patterns before they reach the codebase

```bash
# Install Aegis
npx agent-security-policies --agent opencode --omo
```

Aegis is installed once per project. It is non-destructive — if `.claude/agents/aegis.md` already exists, the installer skips it.

---

## Monorepo Configuration

### Case A: Centralized policy at repo root

Keep one shared policy folder and reference it from each package/app.

Example `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in a package:

```markdown
Follow ALL rules in ../../AGENT_RULES.md.
Reference ../../policies/ for YAML security policies.
```

### Case B: Per-service isolation

Use per-service policy files when teams need different strictness:

```
services/
  payments/AGENT_RULES.md
  payments/policies/
  identity/AGENT_RULES.md
  identity/policies/
```

This allows stricter rules (for example, payments) without affecting other services.

---

## CI Enforcement (Recommended)

Use CI to prevent drift between instructions and policy files.

### Example GitHub Actions check

```yaml
name: Validate Security Policies
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: "3.11"
      - run: pip install pyyaml
      - run: python -c "import yaml,glob; [yaml.safe_load(open(f,encoding='utf-8')) for f in glob.glob('policies/*.yaml')]; print('YAML OK')"
      - run: test -f AGENT_RULES.md
```

### Optional CI policy gates

- Fail PR if `AGENT_RULES.md` changes without corresponding `CHANGELOG.md` update
- Fail PR if policy version is not bumped after security rule changes
- Fail PR if `README.md` agent snippets reference missing files
