## Mandatory Rules

### 1. Input Validation (ASVS V5, CWE-20)

- ✅ Validate ALL inputs at every trust boundary
- ✅ Use **allowlists** over denylists
- ✅ Enforce type, length, range, and format constraints
- ✅ Reject unexpected input — do not try to "clean" it
- ❌ Never trust client-side validation alone
- ❌ Never use user input directly in SQL, OS commands, LDAP, or file paths

### 2. Injection Prevention (CWE-78, CWE-89, CWE-79, CWE-94)

- ✅ **SQL**: Parameterized queries only — never concatenate
- ✅ **OS Commands**: `shell=False` always; resolve binaries via `shutil.which()` or absolute paths
- ✅ **XSS**: Context-aware output encoding; Content-Security-Policy header
- ✅ **Code Injection**: Never `eval()` or `exec()` on untrusted input
- ✅ **Path Traversal**: Resolve to canonical path, validate against allowed directory (CWE-22)
- ✅ **SSRF**: Validate and allowlist URLs; block internal/metadata endpoints (CWE-918)
- ✅ **XXE**: Disable external entity processing in XML parsers (CWE-611)
- ✅ **Deserialization**: Never deserialize untrusted data; use safe formats like JSON (CWE-502)

### 3. Secrets Management (ASVS V6, CWE-798)

- ✅ Use environment variables or a secrets manager (Vault, AWS SM, etc.)
- ✅ Validate that secrets are not placeholders before use
- ❌ **NEVER** hardcode secrets, API keys, tokens, or passwords in source code
- ❌ **NEVER** commit secrets to version control
- ❌ **NEVER** log secrets or include them in error messages

### 4. Authentication & Authorization (CWE-287, CWE-306, CWE-862, CWE-863)

- ✅ Require authentication for all critical functions
- ✅ Check authorization on **every request**, server-side
- ✅ Follow principle of least privilege
- ✅ Deny by default — explicitly grant access
- ✅ Use proven auth libraries (never custom crypto for auth)
- ❌ Never store passwords in plaintext — use bcrypt/argon2/scrypt

### 5. Error Handling & Logging (ASVS V7, CWE-755, NIST AU-3)

- ✅ Use a **typed exception hierarchy** — never raise bare `Exception`
- ✅ Return generic error messages to users
- ✅ Log errors with: severity, timestamp, correlation ID, source, context
- ✅ Handle ALL resource cleanup via `try/finally` or context managers
- ❌ Never expose stack traces, internal paths, or debug info to end users
- ❌ Never log passwords, tokens, PII, or session IDs

### 6. Cryptography (ASVS V6)

- ✅ Use proven libraries only — never roll your own crypto
- ✅ Use strong algorithms: AES-256, SHA-256+, RSA-2048+, Ed25519
- ✅ Use TLS 1.2+ for all network communications
- ✅ Implement proper key rotation
- ❌ Never use deprecated: MD5, SHA-1, DES, RC4, ECB mode

### 7. Dependencies & Supply Chain (SLSA, CWE-1035, NIST SA-12)

- ✅ Pin dependency versions (exact or narrow ranges)
- ✅ Audit for known CVEs before adding a dependency
- ✅ Prefer well-maintained libraries with active security response teams
- ✅ Keep dependencies up to date
- ❌ Never add a dependency without evaluating its security posture

### 8. Subprocess & External Processes (ASVS V5.3, CWE-78)

- ✅ `shell=False` — always
- ✅ Resolve binary paths via `shutil.which()` or absolute paths
- ✅ Validate and sanitize ALL arguments
- ✅ Set explicit timeouts on every subprocess call
- ✅ Capture and validate stdout/stderr before using

### 9. Data Protection (ASVS V8, CWE-200)

- ✅ Classify data by sensitivity
- ✅ Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- ✅ Minimize PII collection and retention
- ✅ Implement proper data disposal
- ❌ Never put sensitive data in URLs, query parameters, or logs

### 10. Concurrency & Race Conditions (CWE-362)

- ✅ Use atomic operations for shared state
- ✅ Implement file locking where needed
- ✅ Avoid shared mutable state
- ✅ Use thread-safe data structures

### 11. API Security (ASVS V13)

- ✅ Authenticate all API endpoints
- ✅ Validate all API parameters
- ✅ Implement rate limiting
- ✅ Use API versioning
- ✅ Return proper HTTP status codes

### 12. Git Safety Protocol

- ✅ Always commit with a descriptive message that explains WHY, not just WHAT
- ✅ Make small, focused commits — one logical change per commit
- ✅ Review changes with `git diff` before staging
- ✅ Stage selectively — `git add <file>` or `git add -p` for partial staging
- ❌ Never force push (`git push --force`) to shared branches
- ❌ Never skip pre-commit hooks (`--no-verify`)
- ❌ Never use `git add -A` or `git add .` without reviewing what will be staged
- ❌ Never modify git history on shared branches
- ❌ Never commit `.env`, secrets, or credentials — use `/checkpoint` before risky operations
- ❌ Never commit generated files that should be in `.gitignore`

## Code Quality Requirements

Every piece of code you produce MUST include:

1. **Type hints** on all public functions and methods
2. **Docstrings** with `Args`, `Returns`, `Raises` for all public APIs
3. **Error handling** with typed exceptions — never bare `except:`
4. **Resource cleanup** via context managers (`with` statements)
5. **Logging** with structured format and correlation IDs
6. **Input validation** at all trust boundaries
7. **No TODO/FIXME** — code must be production-ready
8. **No hardcoded values** — use configuration/environment variables

---

## When You Plan (Architecture / Design)

If asked to plan or design a feature, you MUST include:

### Threat Model (STRIDE)

For each component, analyze:

| Component | Spoofing | Tampering | Repudiation | Info Disclosure | DoS | Elevation |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|-----|-----------|

### Security Architecture

For each module, specify:
- Input validation strategy (ASVS V5)
- Secret management approach (ASVS V6)
- Error handling pattern (ASVS V7)
- Logging requirements (NIST AU-3)
- Authorization model (CWE-862)

---

## When You Audit / Review

If asked to review or audit code, use this checklist:

### Severity Rating

Rate each finding:
- 🔴 **CRITICAL** — Exploitable now, data breach or RCE
- 🟠 **HIGH** — Exploitable with moderate effort
- 🟡 **MEDIUM** — Requires specific conditions to exploit
- 🔵 **LOW** — Minimal impact, defense in depth
- ⚪ **INFO** — Best practice improvement

### Verdict Criteria

- ❌ **FAIL**: Any CRITICAL or ≥3 HIGH findings
- ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**: 1-2 HIGH or ≥3 MEDIUM findings
- ✅ **PASS**: No HIGH+, ≤2 MEDIUM findings
